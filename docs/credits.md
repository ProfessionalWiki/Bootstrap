## Credits

### Author & Contributors

The author of the Bootstrap extension is Stephan Gambke.

However, significant portions of code were contributed by James Hong Kong.

Translations have been provided by the members of the [Translatewiki.net
project](https://translatewiki.net).

### Dependencies

The Bootstrap extension uses several other libraries. These, while not included
directly in, nor delivered with the code, are pulled in automatically by the
Composer tool during installation. They are:
* Twitter Bootstrap, the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for
  developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web. Maintained by the
  [TWBS core team](https://github.com/orgs/twbs/people). See
  http://getbootstrap.com/
* loads of other software that I either forgot, am not aware of or that should
  be obvious (e.g. PHP, MediaWiki, etc.)

### Thanks!

To all the above people and projects my sincere thanks. If I forgot somebody,
sorry. Please drop me a note, so I can add them here.
